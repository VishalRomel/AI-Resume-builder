You’ll be assigned an awesome engineering buddy who’s going to show you the ropes and be the first to peer review your code. You’ll get your MacBook Pro set up and then you’ll start your learning journey with a 3 week long boot camp.On the very first day of the bootcamp, you’ll get to know the release process with your first JIRA ticket - a production bug chosen specifically to help familiarize you with the codebase. You’ll talk over potential solutions with your buddy, pick one, and start cranking. After several minutes / hours, you’ll have a solution. Your solution includes a unit test that replicates the bug. You push your branch to Github and create a pull request. Within a few minutes, our continuous integration software runs the test suite against your code and one of your insanely awesome fellow engineers will code review your solution. Once your code is reviewed with no outstanding issues and all tests pass, you can merge to master and push your code to production. You’ll progress through bootcamp with tickets that will familiarize you with each part of the tech stack - from React to backend, data and analytics, but primarily focusing on our web applications.Once you graduate from our boot camp, you’ll join the mobile app engineering team working on progressively larger features with more responsibility. Several months into your co-op, the features you’ll be designing and implementing will make you indistinguishable from a full-time junior engineer. By the end of your co-op, you will be prepared and confident working in any environment as a mobile software engineer.

You push your branch to Github and create a pull request.
